      All modern websites and web applications are built using<em
        >three fundamental</em
      >
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
      about, and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong> H </strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong> L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language). HTML consists of elements that describe
      different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
      etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <!-- OL : order list with number 1 2 3 and li stand for list item -->
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <!-- UL : un order list  and li stand for list item -->
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
    </ul>
